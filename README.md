# The Wordcels

This is the frontend for The Wordcels project. This is a fork of [this
repo](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle), with changes made to
integrate with NFTs on-chain.

The first two batches are made available in this version; each NFT requires a
1 SOL deposit to mint.

For the vault programs, please go to
[wordcels-programs](https://github.com/wordcels/wordcels-programs).
